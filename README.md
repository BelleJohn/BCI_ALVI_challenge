# 🧠 BCI ALVI Challenge – First Place Solution

This repository documents my approach to winning **first place** in the [BCI Initiative & ALVI Labs - HCI Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bci-initiative-alvi-hci-challenge).

## 🏁 Original Approach

At the time of the competition, I was working full-time as a research assistant. Due to time constraints, I prioritized experimentation over rigorous analysis. My strategy is more like "vibe coding" — I used ChatGPT extensively to resolve issues on the fly and tested as many algorithms as possible, regardless of whether they were theoretically appropriate for the dataset.

I didn’t deeply analyze the data or verify algorithm compatibility. The focus was simply to maximize the competition score with whatever tools and ideas I could implement quickly.

## 🔁 Current Goal: Redoing with a Research-Driven Mindset

I am now revisiting this challenge with a more thoughtful and research-oriented approach. My aim is to:

- Understand the raw data and its underlying structure
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Evaluate model performance with proper metrics
- Choose and tune algorithms based on data characteristics

This repository will evolve as I document this process.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- The `utils` folder includes helper functions to define and train models, load datasets, and visualize predictions.
- The `tutorials` folder contains step-by-step examples for loading the data, training the baseline model, and preparing submissions for the competition.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

Stay tuned as I update this repository with:
- Research insights
- Code refactors
- Experiments with different models and data preprocessing methods
